# Data-Structure-In-C-
In this repository all programs are indivisuals.
<br>
We can define/devide code sequence on there numbering/file name.
<br><br>
If code is 'Singly Linked List' than file name is:<br> 
"FileNumbering_Operation_LinkedListType"
<br><br>
FileNumbering = 1,2,3,...
<br>
Operation = Insert, Delete, Search, Concat, Reverse, ect..<
<br>
LinkedListType = Singly, Doubly, Singly_Circular, Doubly_Circular.
